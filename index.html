                    <h3>Procrastination &amp; Bad Ideas</h3>
                    <p>
                        The second unit of class starts, we start on HTML and CSS.  The assignment is already available.  Due Jan 19th?  <b>Plenty</b> of time.
                        Cold, icy weather on the weekend keeping me indoors should have worked to my benefit for the assignment, but the idea of binge watching netflix and joining my friends
                        to play games on Steam were beckoning to me like the twins from <em>The Shining</em>.

                    <p>
                        Bad photo editing aside, when the due date neared I needed an idea of what to make the assignment about.
                        I thought for a long time, shuffling ideas around.  Both serious and silly ideas.  I wanted something unique, something a bit silly, something that might make people smile.
                        In the end I gave up and settled on this abomination of a topic.

                    <h3>HTMLing (Writing the HTML portion)</h3>
                    <p>
                        With plenty of examples to look off of, and only working with the basics of HTML, this didn't seem too difficult.
                        I mostly breezed through this part, checking with the finished example of this assignment when I needed guidance.
                        I pulled sentences out of thin air to fill up the lines and make this assignment look legitimate.
                        Here's an irrelevant quote to fill space.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        So you think not eating cat food is putting on airs?
                        <footer>-Mac from <em>It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia</em></footer>

                <section>
                    <a name="CSS"></a>
                    <h3>Oh, crap! Here comes the <span class="c">C</span><span class="s1">S</span><span class="s2">S</span><span class="exclamation">!</span></h3>

                    <p>
                        So I got to this part while writing the html, so I have no idea what to put here.  I am also dreading writing the actual CSS because my creative
                         abilities are very limited.  Figuring out what to do to make this page look decent will be a challenge.  I'm sure I'll add more once I write the CSS.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         I took a while to figure out the spacings and colors.  My main goal was to make the "CSS" in the title of this section annoying to look at by overdoing the CSS editing.
                         I constantly tweak, change, and experiment with the CSS and am never fully happy with the result, but I will accept it at some point and stop.
                         I took some ideas from the web and many google searches.  The block quote styling is something I definitely could not have done on my own at this point,
                         but I think I learned a bit experimenting with what I found.
